# Discover_Egypt
Discover Egypt is an app made by the Egyptian team at google android basics challenge 
Please allow us to introduce ourselves to you , we are an Egyptian team who are proud to be a part of this amazing google/udacity android basics scholarship.

Firstly, we thank all the people who played any role in offering this scholarship. Thanks for those who created the idea , who gave us the chance , who put it into action , who administered the whole process in both social communities slack& forum and finally our wonderful fellows all over the world and a very special thanks to whom behind the scene that we believe they have made a great job.

Our team isn’t created to challenge others but to challenge our selves. Actually at the beginning we never thought it would be such excitement and challenging.

We created the app according to criteria that we all agreed it should be adhered to

1-	The app should be helpful to others and presenting a useful material
2-	The app should in a level of complexity that little bit over what we have learned so we could sharpen the skills we gained during the course
3-	And finally to be a core for an app that would some day stand out among other famous apps in the store.
We started meetings in our #egypt channel slack then we created a facebook group to proceed easily since we have experienced some problems in writing English Arabic context on slack so we switched to there.

we used Trello to organize the team project.
we used to have a poll in any critical decision that should be made , discussion some times has been held for three hours we enjoy listen to each other and we all satisfied with the final decision.
Presenting the app

Discover Egypt is the name of our app , it supposed to present Egypt for visitors , you may wonder that we don’t mean foreign visitors only but also Egyptian Visitors !! Egypt has limitless locations and sight seeing that you may not have the chance to visit them all even if you were live in it.
